# FolderSync
 A C# form project with Automatic folder change detection and synchronization.
 Before usage please keep in mind that this application is not done yet.

The usage is very simple when you start up the program you will be welcomed with an information tab which will warn you about a few things related with this program because this is still under development it has known bugs we work on those bugs and in the future we are planning to add more features. So... there are two buttons "Folder Selection" one is for the source folder and the other for the destination. 

After you selected two valid folder then you will have these options to choose of:
 1. "Sync Now": This button will sync the whole folder and it will override the contents of the destination folder.
 2. "Real Time Sync": This button will fire up the automatic change detection (this is not working very well).
 3. "Cancel Real Time": This button will cancel the automatic change detection.

This program by default will remember your last choise of folders and this program will make log entries of your changes when you are working with the automatic change detection.

If you want to see how many setting are tweakable check config.conf or in the program click on the "More Options" button.
